## Class Notes

- **Data** is a collection of **objects** and their **attributes**.
- You have a *big data problem* when you have more data than is easy to work
with on your device and/or constraints.
- **Big data** is when you have a collection of data sets so large and complex
that it becomes difficult to process using traditional data processing
applications.
- The 4 V's: **variety, volume, velocity, veracity**.
